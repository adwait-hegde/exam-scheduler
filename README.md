# Exam Scheduler

This is a DAA mini-project that is based on the implementation of the Graph Colouring Algorithm. This project uses the backtracking algorithm to colour the graph and find a schedule such that no two exams of one student clash.

Implemented on Django Framework

## Algorithm
#### Vertex Coloring: 
The vertex colouring problem for a graph requires assigning each vertex of the graph a colour such that no two adjacent vertices are of the same colour.

#### Chromatic Number: 
The chromatic number is the minimum number of colours needed to colour a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are of the same colour.

## Goals

**OPTIMIZATION** : Maximize profit and minimize cost.

**EQUITY** : Making things fair for all the participants.

**CONFLICT RESOLUTION** : Preventing conflicts from happening between events
